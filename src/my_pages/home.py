        Our team of engineers develops software tools and services that are
        useful and easy to use for the average citizen. One of our services, for
        example, is designed to help users understand the risk of getting infected
        of COVID by calculating their probabilities of death when compared to
        previous similar cases of SARS-CoV-2 (check it out by opening the lateral
        menu!). \n
        Our roadmap of future features include:
        * A life expectancy forecasting service, to calculate the approximate time of life critical pacients have before dying, helping medical personnel to better focus their effort and talent.
        * A recovery time forecasting service, that estimates the average time a non-critical hospitalized pacient is going to spend at the hospital to recover, providing a way to predict hospital occupation rates in advance.
        * General interactive visualization tools so every mexican citizen has access to updated information about infections, deaths and recent upbursts of COVID-19 cases all acrooss the country.
